                <p>Chheng has a new weapon in the battle against poachers: Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security
                    (PAWS), predictive AI software that crunches massive amounts of data and leverages machine learning
                    to suggest the most effective patrol routes.</p>
                <hr>
                <p> Two generations ago, this was a remote corner of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in eastern Cambodia. Now,
                    on this steamy February morning, Chheng leads his team into Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary for
                    another long, exhausting and potentially dangerous day.

                    Clad in camouflage green, Chheng leads seven rangers who fall into formation behind him. They
                    walk single file. Their stoic faces betray a mixture of determination and slight fear, their
                    eyes constantly scanning for animal snares, footprints, bullet cartridges and motorbike
                    tracksâ€”telltale signs of poachers. Suddenly, the sound of a chainsaw in the distance shatters
                    the silence.<a href="#">dis parturient montes</a> Chheng's face tightens. Illegal loggers could
                    mean poachers. Last year, poachers murdered four Cambodian rangers, and they have killed 10 over
                    the past five years, according to Rohit Singh, a former ranger and president of Ranger
                    Federation Asia, which oversees ranger training throughout Asia. In early February, illegal
                    hunters shot and injured a Srepok ranger in a firefight. After his evacuation, poachers pumped
                    his abandoned motorbike with 13 bullets.

                    Chheng raises him arm for the rangers to stop, then opens his arms wide, a sign for them to
                    spread out and deploy behind trees and desiccated stalks of grass. The rangers slowly advance.

                <blockquote>
                    <p class="lead">The brainchild of Professor Milind Tambe, a USC Viterbi computer scientist and co-founder of the
                        USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS), PAWS uses algorithms to intelligently
                        randomize ranger schedules to combat poaching by keeping the poachers off-balance, making it
                        impossible for them to identify exploitable patrol patterns. Poachers have no idea when and
                        where rangers will appear.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Through its integration with the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART), PAWS could be
                    introduced into about 100 wildlife sanctuaries in Africa and Asia by early next year, and 300 to 600
                    worldwide by the end of 2020, according to Jonathan Palmer, chief technology officer of the SMART
                    partnership, a consortium of nine global conservation agencies including Wildlife Conservation
                    Society (WCS), WWF and Panthera, and more than 60 governmental partners committed to improving the
                </p>

                <p>
                    SMART is a digital tracking tool that allows rangers to collect and manage patrol data, said Palmer,
                    who also serves as executive director of strategic technology at WCS. Conservation agencies have
                    successfully deployed it at natural reserves around the world, leveraging historical data to help
                    rangers identify areas likely to attract illicit hunting and logging. Unlike PAWS, though, SMART
                    cannot predict poaching hotspots. That's why the combination of SMART and PAWS should prove so
                    powerful.
